# Minesweeper Game
Collaborative final project for 2018 Spring Intro to Computer Science class.
* Description: We generated a minesweeper game using recursion. Players could also chat during the game. The system is also supplemented with a player feedback interface: When game finishes due to win/lose, the game will pop up an interface to collect feedbacks & users can choose to hide their names.
